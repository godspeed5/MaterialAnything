## Material3D Dataset  

**Material3D** consists of over 80,000 3D objects with material maps curated from [Objaverse](https://objaverse.allenai.org/). The object IDs and Blender scripts are publicly available. Additionally, prompts from [3DTopia](https://github.com/3DTopia/3DTopia) and [Cap3D](https://cap3d-um.github.io/) are also provided.  

---

### Install Blender  

Our Blender scripts are based on **Blender 3.2.2**. While newer Blender versions have been tested, some node names have changed, which may cause compatibility issues. It is recommended to install Blender 3.2.2.  

```bash
# Download Blender 3.2.2
wget https://download.blender.org/release/Blender3.2/blender-3.2.2-linux-x64.tar.xz
tar -xf blender-3.2.2-linux-x64.tar.xz
rm blender-3.2.2-linux-x64.tar.xz

# Add Blender to PATH in ~/.bashrc
export PATH="/path/to/blender-folder:$PATH"

# Refresh the environment variables
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Material Rendering  

The following commands can be used to render material maps:  

#### Render Multi-view Material Maps  
```bash
blender -b -P ./rendering_scripts/blender_script_material.py -- \
    --object_path "./my_object.glb" \
    --output_dir './dataset/outputs' \
    --render_space 'VIEW'
```

#### Render UV-space Material Maps  
```bash
blender -b -P ./rendering_scripts/blender_script_material.py -- \
    --object_path "./my_object.glb" \
    --output_dir './dataset/outputs' \
    --render_space 'UV'
```

---

### Distributed Material Rendering  

For large-scale rendering, we provide a distributed rendering script. You can modify it based on your dataset and system configuration.  

#### Example Usage:  
```bash
python rendering_scripts/distributed_render.py \
    --timeout 3600 \
    --num_gpus 8 \
    --workers_per_gpu 12 \
    --input_models_path './models_path_all.json' \
    --resolution 512 \
    --render_space 'VIEW'
```

---

### Notes  

- Ensure that the Blender binary path is correctly added to your `PATH` environment variable before executing any scripts.  
- For distributed rendering, adjust the `--num_gpus`, `--workers_per_gpu`, and `--timeout` parameters based on your hardware setup.  
- Use the `--render_space` flag to specify whether to render in `VIEW` or `UV` space.

## Abstract
>We present <b>Material Anything</b>, a fully-automated, 
unified diffusion framework designed to generate physically-based materials for 3D objects. 
Unlike existing methods that rely on complex pipelines or case-specific optimizations, 
Material Anything offers a robust, end-to-end solution adaptable to objects under diverse lighting conditions. 
Our approach leverages a pre-trained image diffusion model, 
enhanced with a triple-head architecture and rendering loss to improve stability and material quality. 
Additionally, we introduce confidence masks as a dynamic switcher within the diffusion model, 
enabling it to effectively handle both textured and texture-less objects across varying lighting conditions. 
By employing a progressive material generation strategy guided by these confidence masks, 
along with a UV-space material refiner, our method ensures consistent, UV-ready material outputs. 
Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing methods across a wide range of object categories 
and lighting conditions.

<b>Overview of Material Anything.</b> For texture-less objects, 
we first generate coarse textures using image diffusion models. 
For objects with pre-existing textures, we directly process them. 
Next, a material estimator progressively estimates materials for each view from a rendered image, 
normal, and confidence mask. The confidence mask serves as additional guidance for illuminance uncertainty, 
addressing lighting variations in the input image and enhancing consistency across generated multi-view materials. 
These materials are then unwrapped into UV space and refined by a material refiner.
